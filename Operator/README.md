# SDK Operator App

This app is used to test, debug, and develop features the Apptentive SDK. It is *not* intended as an example of how to integrate the Apptentive SDK with your app. For and example of how to integrate the Apptentive SDK with your app, please see the Example app.

## Setup

Rename the `Credentials-Template.xcconfig` file to `Credentials.xcconfig`. Then edit the file to replace the placeholders with the Apptentive App Key and Apptentive App Signature for the app you would like to test against (in this case "app" means one that is set up in the Apptentive dashboard rather than one that is installed on a mobile device or simulator).
