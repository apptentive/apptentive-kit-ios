/// Stores values used in random sampling.
///
/// Previously the random values were generated on demand, deep inside a function call stack,
/// so propagating the values back up to the canonical `Conversation` object
/// would have been tricky, and for that reason we made this object a class so that it had reference semantics.
///
/// That became problematic with the new Swift 6 concurrency requirements, because the class
/// was not Sendable.
///
/// The new approach is to generate a random seed when the object is first initialized
/// (or when it is decoded and the seed is absent).
///
/// When there is an existing entry in the `values` array, it is returned
/// for backward compatibility.
///
/// When a new random value is required, it computes an MD5 hash of the
/// combination of the key and the seed, takes the integer value of the first
/// two bytes, and normalizes it to a value between 0 and 100.
///
/// This should provide a value that is randomized both across different
/// `key`s as well as across different conversations.
